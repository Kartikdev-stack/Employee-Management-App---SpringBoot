// respository is a special label we put on an interface to tell Spring that this is a repository and it is meant to manage data (CRUD) in database.
//JpaRepository<Employee,Long> is  super storage manager that aldready knows how to do basic stuff and it is provided with two things, firstly iy will mnage obhjects of 
// of type Employee and dataa typeof identifiier is Long

// EmployeeRepository is like a ready-made tool that you can use to manage Employee data in the database. It  gives it all the necessary powers to do that, so you donâ€™t need to write the basic database management code yourself.
